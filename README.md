# Above 8 000: Data at Altitude

## Overview
This repository showcases interesting statistics derived from a dataset of **Himalayan expeditions spanning from 1905 to 2020**. The project serves as both a learning exercise in using the Pandas library and a tribute to my grandfather, **Vladislav Terzyul**.    
     
Vladislav nearly became the 13th person in history to summit all of the world’s **8,000-meter peaks** without supplemental oxygen — an extraordinary feat. Sadly, he passed away on May 17, 2004, during his descent from **Makalu**, the final summit of his journey. A few peaks he climbed were not officially recognized or judged, but his legacy remains monumental.   

> _“Above 8,000” is not only a data project — it's a reflection of human endurance, legacy, and the stories told by mountains._

### Note
This dataset focuses specifically on the **Himalayan range** and does not include peaks like **K2 (Chogori)**, **Broad Peak**, or **Gasherbrum**, as they are part of the **Karakoram range** in Pakistan — not technically the Himalayas. (Yes, that surprised me too...)
